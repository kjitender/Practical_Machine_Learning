### Objective and Goal

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

The objective of the project is to predict the manner in which participants did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. 

Objectives

 - To create a report describing how the model is built
 - How to  pre process and use cross validation
 - Interpretation of expected out of sample error 
 - Appropiate reasons of the choices made and finally
 - Use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

### Background and Data

Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
